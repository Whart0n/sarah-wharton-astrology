## My Journey to Astrology

My fascination with the stars began with mundane astrology—the branch of astrology that explores how planetary movements influence nations, cities, and global events rather than individuals. As early as middle school, I was weaving the study of time into my papers—exploring decades (especially the 1960s), generational theory, and the concept of repeating cycles. These themes have captivated me for as long as I can remember.

<br />

After years of personal study, I earned my certification from Chris Brennan in 2022. I launched my astrology practice with the mission of making astrology accessible, practical, and empowering. When I'm not providing readings, I'm deepening my studies in natal astrology, tarot, and other esoteric traditions.

<br />

Before I embraced astrology professionally, my career centered around government administration, public affairs, and entrepreneurship. This background has helped shape the grounded, real-world lens I bring to my astrological work.

<br />

To me, astrology is a tool for transformation—not simply describing who we are, but guiding us toward who we're meant to become. By understanding the cosmic patterns woven into our birth charts, we can uncover the soul's journey and the unique gifts we're here to express.

## What to Expect in a Reading 

My sessions are collaborative and conversational. I offer a safe, non-judgmental space for reflection, insight, and discovery. Whether you're completely new to astrology or a longtime student of your chart, I'll meet you where you are and provide insights that are both accessible and profound.

<br />

Each reading includes detailed chart analysis alongside practical guidance for integrating that insight into your daily life. My goal is not only to interpret your chart, but to help you apply its wisdom in a way that supports your growth and well-being.
