## My Journey to Astrology

My fascination with the stars began in childhood, gazing at the night sky and feeling a profound connection to something greater than myself. That early wonder eventually led me to formal study of astrology, where I discovered the rich language of the cosmos and its remarkable ability to illuminate our human experience.

After years of personal study and professional training, I founded Cosmic Insight with a mission to make astrology accessible, practical, and empowering for everyone seeking cosmic guidance.

## My Background

With over a decade of experience practicing astrology professionally, I've worked with clients from all walks of life and from around the world. My approach is informed by both traditional and modern astrological techniques, allowing me to draw from astrology's rich historical tradition while making it relevant to contemporary life.

I hold certification from the National Council for Geocosmic Research (NCGR) and have completed advanced studies in various specialized areas, including:

- Psychological Astrology
- Evolutionary Astrology
- Timing Techniques
- Relationship Astrology
- Medical Astrology

In addition to my one-on-one client work, I regularly contribute to astrological publications and teach workshops for both beginners and advanced students.

## My Practice

Each reading is a sacred space where the wisdom of the stars meets your lived experience. I approach every chart with respect, sensitivity, and a commitment to ethical practice. My goal is never to predict a fixed future, but rather to illuminate potentials and empower you to work consciously with the cosmic energies at play in your life.

I believe astrology is a tool for transformationâ€”not just telling us who we are, but helping us become who we're meant to be. By understanding the cosmic patterns woven into our birth charts, we gain insight into our soul's journey and the unique gifts we're here to express.
