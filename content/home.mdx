# Welcome

I'm passionate about working with clients and sharing astrological insight to help guide you on your path. Through personalized readings, we'll explore your unique birth chart in the context of life cycles, relationships, career, spiritual growth, and both short- and long-term challenges.

<br />

My approach to astrology is both intuitive and practical, centered on empowerment rather than prediction. I don't believe the stars dictate your fate—instead, they reveal your innate strengths and challenges, helping you make conscious choices aligned with your highest potential. Together, we'll find the best way for you to play the hand you were dealt.

<br />

I blend ancient Hellenistic methods with modern techniques, incorporating select asteroids and fixed stars. Whether you're new to astrology or a seasoned student, my readings are tailored to meet you where you are—offering grounded insights and practical guidance for your current journey.

<br />

When you book a session, my time is fully devoted to you. Please include in your booking message what you'd like to focus on and your level of astrology experience. Whether you're seeking clarity on your life purpose, navigating relationships, or facing important career or spiritual decisions, we'll dig deep to uncover the answers.

<br />

I'm confident our work together will offer meaningful perspective and direction. Feel free to reach out with any questions about how astrology can support you.
